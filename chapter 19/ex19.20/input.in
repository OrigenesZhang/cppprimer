Ode to the Giraffe
A Sonnet by Anon
My neat giraffe, you inspire me to write.
How I hate the way you bark, hoot and hop,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the plump bellhop.

Let me compare you to a sanctuary?
You are more awful, lawful and gentle.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the waffle rental.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your humour, toenails and eyebrows.
Thinking of your fun toenails fills my days.
My hate for you is the unlawful choughs.

Now I must away with a woful heart,
Remember my live words whilst we're apart.
